# COMPAS-Recidivism-Racial-Bias

COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendantâ€™s likelihood of reoffending (recidivism). It has been shown that the algorithm is biased in favor of white defendants, and against black inmates, based on a 2 year follow up study (i.e who actually committed crimes or violent crimes after 2 years). The pattern of mistakes, as measured by precision/sensitivity is notable.
